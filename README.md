# quantifying_luck_baseball_logistic_reg
Utilizing StatCast data to investigate who the luckiest and unluckiest players were in Major League Baseball via Logistic Regression.

The model attempted to predict if a batted ball was a hit or an out based off the StatCast launch speed and launch angle. Before the model was created, graphs suggested that there would not be any predictive power using either of these metrics. As expected, the model predicted all batted balls to be outs leading to the following conclusions:
1. Launch speed and launch angle by themselves do not hold enough predictive power to project base hits.
2. Hits come in an extremely wide variety of launch speeds and angles.

This model gave a new meaning to "it looks like a line drive in the scorebook!"
